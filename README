WARNING:

	Tempi can't be considered to be stable. I'm assuming that there are some 
	bugs, which didn't occur when I was using/testing Tempi. I'm overall 
	fearing undefined behaviour. So if something isn't valid to ISO/IEC 9899, 
	please inform me.


INSTALLATION:

	%perl Makefile.PL
	%make
	%make test
	%make install
 
	Notes for Installation: 

		-Tempi needs flex to be installed, assuming %flex to work.
		If that's not the case, change the Makefile.PL


TODO
	
	-makeing -O1||2||3 working, actuall, code optimization causes strange
	errors...
	
	-replacing the actual brutal force algorithm with a nicer hash 
	algorithm, that could give some additional speed
	
	-introducing perls own allocation functions
